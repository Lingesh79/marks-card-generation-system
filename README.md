# marks-card-generation-system
This system is used to generate marks card of student for particular year(i.e. two semesters).

In an engineering college it is hard to manage all student’s marks and print each of their marks cards. As of now it is harder to manage the student’s marks itself. 

So to overcome this we have come up with a programming solution in which if we enter particular student details like his name, parent’s name, USN, credits, subject name’s and respective subject mark’s the program will itself compute the grade, grade points, result, CGPA, SGPA and class obtained by the student not only that the program will also display respective students marks card which can be easily printed for the record. 

This saves a lot of time and it can definitely be a solution for this time consuming work. 

We make use of inheritance,class,objects,switch cases,constructors and other functionalities to produce an object oriented solution for the particular problem.
